# UX Improvements - December 2024

## Overview
This document summarizes the user experience improvements made to enhance the node connection workflow and Image Panel consistency.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Alert Notifications

**Problem**: Users were being shown popup notifications for obvious actions that had clear visual feedback.

**Solution**: Removed alert notifications for:
- Image Panel node creation from drag-and-drop
- Connection deletions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/CreativeNodeFlow.tsx`:
  - Line ~1043: Removed `alertService.info()` call in `onEdgesDelete`
  - Line ~1078: Removed `alertService.success()` call in `handleDrop`

**Rationale**: These actions have immediate visual feedback (node appears, edge disappears), so popup notifications are redundant and potentially distracting.

### 2. Consistent Image Panel Sizing

**Problem**: Image Panel nodes had inconsistent sizing behavior. Images were set to `width: 100%` which caused the node to expand unpredictably based on the parent container.

**Solution**: Implemented dynamic sizing with aspect ratio preservation:
1. Default node width set to **350px** (plus 32px padding)
2. Height calculated dynamically based on image aspect ratio
3. Node automatically resizes when image loads
4. Node resets to default size when image is deleted

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ImagePanelNode.tsx`:
  - Added `updateNodeSize` callback to calculate and apply node dimensions
  - Added `onLoad` handler to `<img>` element to detect image dimensions
  - Updated `handleDeleteImage` to reset node size when image is cleared

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
const TARGET_WIDTH = 350; // Target node width in pixels
const PADDING = 32; // 16px padding on each side
const aspectRatio = height / width;
const scaledHeight = TARGET_WIDTH * aspectRatio;

// Node dimensions
nodeWidth = TARGET_WIDTH + PADDING (382px)
nodeHeight = scaledHeight + PADDING + 100 (extra space for header/status)
```

**User Experience**: Users now see consistent, predictable Image Panel sizes that maintain the original image aspect ratio.

### 3. Context Refresh on Connection Changes

**Problem**: When connections were deleted, the accumulated input context (`inputContext`) in AgentPromptNode was not cleared, potentially leading to stale context data.

**Solution**: Added connection change detection to clear stale context when edges are removed.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/AgentPromptNode.tsx`:
  - Added `setInputContext` from `usePromptNode` hook
  - Added `useEffect` to track connection changes via `inputNodeIds`
  - Clears `inputContext` when connections are removed

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
// Track previous connection IDs
const previousInputNodeIdsRef = React.useRef<string[]>(inputNodeIds);

React.useEffect(() => {
  const removedConnections = previousIds.filter(
    prevId => !currentIds.includes(prevId)
  );
  
  if (removedConnections.length > 0) {
    setInputContext(null); // Clear stale context
  }
  
  previousInputNodeIdsRef.current = currentIds;
}, [inputNodeIds, setInputContext]);
```

**Why This Works**:
1. **On connection creation**: `onConnect` handler transmits existing data immediately
2. **During execution**: `inputNodes` from `useStore` provides fresh node data
3. **On connection deletion**: Context is cleared to prevent stale data

**User Experience**: Prompts always execute with current, up-to-date context that reflects the actual node connections.

## Verification

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Image Panel nodes maintain aspect ratio
- [x] Image Panel default width is 350px
- [x] No alerts when dragging files to create Image Panel
- [x] No alerts when deleting connections
- [x] Context refreshes when connections are added
- [x] Context clears when connections are deleted
- [x] No TypeScript errors

### Files Changed
1. `src/CreativeNodeFlow.tsx` - Alert removal
2. `src/components/ImagePanelNode.tsx` - Sizing improvements
3. `src/components/AgentPromptNode.tsx` - Context refresh logic

## Benefits

1. **Less Intrusive**: Removed unnecessary notifications that interrupted workflow
2. **More Consistent**: Image Panel nodes have predictable, aspect-ratio-preserving dimensions
3. **More Reliable**: Context always reflects current connection state

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding similar connection change detection to other nodes if they start accumulating state
- Monitor Image Panel sizing for very tall/narrow images (may want to set max height constraint)
- Consider adding visual indicators for connection state changes instead of alerts
